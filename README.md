# Programmatic Access to OpenTopography Lidar Data via Tile Indexes
This repository provides a Jupyter notebook example showcasing two complementary approaches for accessing and working with tiled point cloud datasets.

The first method uses an OpenTopography tile index to automatically locate and download only the files that intersect a chosen area of interest.

The second introduces a cloud-native workflow powered by PDAL, which streams point cloud data directly from remote storageâ€”enabling clipping and processing on-the-fly without the need to download lidar tiles locally.
